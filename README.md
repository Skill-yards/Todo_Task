### **Task: To-Do List Application with CRUD Operations and Animations**

#### **Objective:**
Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application should store data in the browser's local storage, and include animations and greeting words on the home page.

#### **Requirements:**

1. **Home Page:**
   - Display a greeting message based on the time of day (e.g., "Good Morning!", "Good Afternoon!", "Good Evening!").
   - Include a smooth fade-in animation for the greeting message when the page loads.
   - Provide a brief introduction or welcome text explaining the purpose of the to-do list application.

2. **To-Do List Page:**
   - **Create:** Allow users to add new tasks to the to-do list. Each task should have a title and description.
   - **Read:** Display the list of tasks dynamically from local storage.
   - **Update:** Provide functionality to edit an existing task's title and description.
   - **Delete:** Enable users to remove tasks from the list.
   - **Local Storage:** Save all tasks in local storage, ensuring that the to-do list persists across page reloads.

3. **Animations:**
   - Apply animations to the add, edit, and delete operations. For example:
     - A slide-in effect when a new task is added.
     - A smooth transition when a task is edited.
     - A fade-out effect when a task is deleted.
   - Add hover effects to buttons and list items to enhance user interaction.

4. **User Interface:**
   - Use CSS to style the application, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
   - Make use of CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.
   - Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

5. **Bonus:**
   - Add a feature to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
   - Include a filter option to view only completed, incomplete, or all tasks.

#### **Submission Instructions:**

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub with the name `todo-list-app`.
   - Set up the repository with a descriptive `README.md` file that explains the project, its features, and how to use it.
   - Make sure to include the following files:
     - `index.html`: The main HTML file.
     - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling.
     - `script.js`: The JavaScript file for functionality.
     - Any additional assets (images, fonts, etc.).

2. **Commit and Push:**
   - Commit your work with meaningful commit messages that describe what you have done.
   - Push your final code to the GitHub repository.

3. **Submission:**
   - Share the GitHub repository link by submitting it to your instructor or through the designated submission platform.

4. **Optional (if you're using GitHub Pages):**
   - Deploy the application using GitHub Pages.
   - Include the live link to your deployed application in the `README.md` file.

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- Correct implementation of CRUD operations and local storage.
- Effective use of animations and greeting messages.
- Clean and responsive design.
- Code quality, including comments and structure.
- Proper use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
